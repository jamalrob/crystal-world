# The Crystal World

A blog application written in Crystal without a framework, inspired by the [Frameworkless Manifesto](https://github.com/frameworkless-movement/manifesto).

The main objectives here are:

- Implementing the basics without a framework:
  - routing
  - authentication
  - template rendering
  - data access
  - CSRF and XSS prevention
- Testing different patterns and architectures
- Learning a new programming language that's as nice to read as Python or Ruby, and yet _fast_
- Building a groundwork for small real-world projects that's easy and enjoyable to use
- Continuing with HTMX and Hyperscript

### Coming soon

- HTMX active search
- Admin/CMS section, using HTMX <=> API endpoints in Crystal
