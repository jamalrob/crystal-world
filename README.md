# The Crystal World

A blog application written in Crystal without a framework, inspired by the [Frameworkless Manifesto](https://github.com/frameworkless-movement/manifesto). The main objectives here are testing different patterns and architectures, and learning a new programming language that's as nice to read as Python or Ruby, but _fast_.

### Coming soon

- HTMX active search
- CRUD for articles using HTMX <=> API endpoints in Crystal
