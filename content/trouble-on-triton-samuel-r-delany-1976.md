I think _Trouble on Triton_ was Delany's favoured title, but in the end it was published just as _Triton_, for whatever reason, and my own Kindle version has that shorter title. I'm going with the longer title, not only because Delany wanted it that way but also because I prefer it.

The last (and first) Delany I read was _Nova_, which I [reviewed here](/nova-by-samuel-r-delany-1968). That book was written around eight years before _Trouble on Triton_, and the latter's prose is immediately much more impressive and controlled---although it's still pretty odd: parentheses are almost as common as commas [EXAG], and I often had to go back to the beginning when I realized I had carelessly charged ahead and over the edge. And that's the point, I think: Delany wants us to slow down.
